<h2><a id="purpose" name="purpose">Purpose of the Scrum Guide</a></h2>
<p>Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. This Guide contains the definition
    of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. Ken
    Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland developed Scrum; the Scrum Guide is written and provided by them. Together, they stand
    behind the Scrum Guide.</p>
<h2><a id="definition" name="definition">Definition of Scrum</a></h2>
<p>Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively
    delivering products of the highest possible value.</p>
<p>Scrum is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lightweight</li>
    <li>Simple to understand</li>
    <li>Difficult to master</li>
</ul>
<p>Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage work on complex products since the early 1990s. Scrum is
    not a process, technique, or definitive method. Rather, it is a
    framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear
    the relative efficacy of your product management and work techniques so that you can continuously improve
    the product, the team, and the working environment.</p>
<p>The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and
    rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to
    Scrum’s success and usage.</p>
<p>The rules of Scrum bind together the roles, events, and artifacts, governing the relationships and
    interaction between them. The rules of Scrum are described throughout the body of this
    document.</p>
<p>Specific tactics for using the Scrum framework vary and are described elsewhere.</p>
<h2><a id="uses" name="uses">Uses of Scrum</a></h2>
<p>Scrum was initially developed for managing and developing products. Starting in the early 1990s,
    Scrum has been used extensively, worldwide, to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities;</li>
    <li>Develop products and enhancements;</li>
    <li>Release products and enhancements, as frequently as many times per day;</li>
    <li>Develop and sustain Cloud (online, secure, on-demand) and other operational environments for product use; and,
    </li>
    <li>Sustain and renew products.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scrum has been used to develop software, hardware, embedded software, networks of
    interacting function, autonomous vehicles, schools, government, marketing, managing the
    operation of organizations and almost everything we use in our daily lives, as individuals and
    societies.</p>
<p>As technology, market, and environmental complexities and their interactions have rapidly
    increased, Scrum’s utility in dealing with complexity is proven daily.</p>
<p>Scrum proved especially effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer. Scrum is now
    widely used for products, services, and the management of the parent organization.</p>
<p>The essence of Scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and
    adaptive. These strengths continue operating in single, several, many, and networks of teams
    that develop, release, operate and sustain the work and work products of thousands of people.
    They collaborate and interoperate through sophisticated development architectures and target
    release environments.</p>
<p>When the words "develop" and "development" are used in the Scrum Guide, they refer to
    complex work, such as those types identified above.</p>
<h2><a id="theory" name="theory">Scrum Theory</a></h2>
<p>Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that
    knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum
    employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
    Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency,
    inspection, and adaptation.</p>
<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. Transparency requires those
    aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a
    common understanding of what is being seen.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants; and,</li>
    <li>Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share a common definition of
        "Done".
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Inspection</h3>
<p>Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect
    undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way
    of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at
    the point of work.</p>
<h3>Adaptation</h3>
<p>If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable
    limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being
    processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize
    further deviation.</p>
<p>Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of this
    document:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sprint Planning</li>
    <li>Daily Scrum</li>
    <li>Sprint Review</li>
    <li>Sprint Retrospective</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="value" name="values">Scrum Values</a></h2>
<p>When the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the
    Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life
    and build trust for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they work with the Scrum
    events, roles and artifacts.</p>
<p>Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values. People
    personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right
    thing and work on tough problems. Everyone focuses on the work
    of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the
    work and the challenges with
    performing the work. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.</p>
<h2><a id="team" name="team">The Scrum Team</a></h2>
<p>The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.
    Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to
    accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional
    teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not
    part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and
    productivity. The Scrum Team has proven itself to be increasingly effective for all the earlier
    stated uses, and any complex work.</p>
<p>Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for
    feedback. Incremental deliveries of "Done" product ensure a potentially useful version of
    working product is always available.</p>
<h3><a id="team-po" name="team-po">The Product Owner</a></h3>
<p>The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the
    Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and
    individuals.</p>
<p>The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product
    Backlog management includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;</li>
    <li>Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;</li>
    <li>Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;</li>
    <li>Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will
        work on next; and,
    </li>
    <li>Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the
    Product Owner remains accountable.</p>
<p>The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the
    desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog
    item’s priority must address the Product Owner.</p>
<p>For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The
    Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No
    one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.</p>
<h3><a id="team-dev" name="team-dev">The Development Team</a></h3>
<p>The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially
    releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. A "Done" increment is required at the
    Sprint Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.</p>
<p>Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and
    manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall
    efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Development Teams have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product
        Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
    </li>
    <li>Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
    </li>
    <li>Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person;
    </li>
    <li>Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like
        testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis; and,
    </li>
    <li>Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs
        to the Development Team as a whole.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Development Team Size</h3>
<p>Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to
    complete significant work within a Sprint. Fewer than three Development Team members
    decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller Development Teams may
    encounter skill constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to
    deliver a potentially releasable Increment. Having more than nine members requires too much
    coordination. Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process
    to be useful. The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless
    they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.</p>
<h3><a id="team-sm" name="team-sm">The Scrum Master</a></h3>
<p>The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters
    do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those
    outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful
    and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the
    value created by the Scrum Team.</p>
<h4>Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner</h4>
<p>The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum
        Team as well as possible;
    </li>
    <li>Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;</li>
    <li>Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;</li>
    <li>Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;</li>
    <li>Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;</li>
    <li>Understanding and practicing agility; and,</li>
    <li>Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scrum Master Service to the Development Team</h4>
<p>The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;</li>
    <li>Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;</li>
    <li>Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress;</li>
    <li>Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed; and,</li>
    <li>Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and
        understood.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Scrum Master Service to the Organization</h4>
<p>The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;</li>
    <li>Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;</li>
    <li>Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;</li>
    <li>Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team; and,</li>
    <li>Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the
        organization.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="events" name="events">Scrum Events</a></h2>
<p>Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings
    not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum
    duration. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The
    remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an
    appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.</p>
<p>Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is a
    formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something. These events are specifically designed to
    enable critical transparency and inspection. Failure to include any of these events results in
    reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt.</p>
<h3><a id="events-sprint" name="events-sprint">The Sprint</a></h3>
<p>The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable,
    and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations
    throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the
    previous Sprint.</p>
<p>Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the
    Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.</p>
<p>During the Sprint:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;</li>
    <li>Quality goals do not decrease; and,</li>
    <li>Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon. Like projects,
    Sprints are used to accomplish something. Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a
    design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product increment.</p>
<p>Sprints are limited to one calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the definition of
    what is being built may change, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Sprints enable
    predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least
    every calendar month. Sprints also limit risk to one calendar month of cost.</p>
<h4>Cancelling a Sprint</h4>
<p>A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the
    authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the
    stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master.</p>
<p>A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the
    company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint
    should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. But, due to the short
    duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense.</p>
<p>When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed. If
    part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete
    Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog. The work done on
    them depreciates quickly and must be frequently re-estimated.</p>
<p>Sprint cancellations consume resources, since everyone regroups in another Sprint
    Planning to start another Sprint. Sprint cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum Team,
    and are very uncommon.</p>
<h3><a id="events-planning" name="events-planning">Sprint Planning</a></h3>
<p>The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by
    the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.</p>
<p>Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter
    Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and
    that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it
    within the time-box.</p>
<p>Sprint Planning answers the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?</li>
    <li>How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?</h4>
<p>The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the
    Sprint. The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the
    Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire
    Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.</p>
<p>The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected
    capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development
    Team. The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the
    Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the
    upcoming Sprint.</p>
<p>During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team also crafts a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met
    within the
    Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the
    Development Team on why it is building the Increment.</p>
<h4>Topic Two: how will the chosen work get done?</h4>
<p>Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the
    Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment
    during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering
    them is called the Sprint Backlog.</p>
<p>The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert
    the Product Backlog into a working product Increment. Work may be of varying size, or
    estimated effort. However, enough work is planned during Sprint Planning for the Development
    Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. Work planned for the first
    days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to
    units of one day or less. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the
    Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint.</p>
<p>The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs.
    If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the
    selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner. The Development Team may also invite
    other people to attend to provide technical or domain advice.</p>
<p>By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the
    Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to
    accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment. </p>
<h4>Sprint Goal</h4>
<p>The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of
    Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the
    Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the
    Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.
    The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal.
    The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work
    together rather than on separate initiatives.</p>
<p>As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint
    Goal, it implements functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than
    the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the
    scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.</p>
<h3><a id="events-daily" name="events-daily">Daily Scrum</a></h3>
<p>The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the
    Sprint.
    At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by
    inspecting the work since the
    last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day
    to reduce complexity.</p>
<p>The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is
    trending toward completing
    the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the
    Sprint Goal. Every day, the
    Development Team should understand how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the
    Sprint Goal and create the anticipated
    Increment by the end of the Sprint.</p>
<p>The structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different
    ways if it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal. Some Development Teams will use
    questions, some will be more discussion based. Here is an example of what might be used:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>
    <li>What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>
    <li>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions, or to
    adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for
    conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the
    15-minute time-box.</p>
<p>The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Development Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that
    they do not disrupt the meeting.</p>
<p>Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to development for removal,
    highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the Development Team’s level of knowledge. This is a key
    inspect and adapt meeting.</p>
<h3><a id="events-review" name="events-review">Sprint Review</a></h3>
<p>A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.
    During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on
    that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could
    be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment
    is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.</p>
<p>This is at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The
    Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place
    and that attendees understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches everyone involved to keep it within the
    time-box.</p>
<p>The Sprint Review includes the following elements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;</li>
    <li>The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done";</li>
    <li>The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those
        problems were solved;
    </li>
    <li>The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment;</li>
    <li>The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely target and delivery
        dates based on progress to date (if needed);
    </li>
    <li>The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to
        subsequent Sprint Planning;
    </li>
    <li>Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing
        to do next; and,
    </li>
    <li>Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of
        functionality or capability of the product.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the
    next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.</p>
<h3><a id="events-retro" name="events-retro">Sprint Retrospective</a></h3>
<p>The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to
    be enacted during the next Sprint.</p>
<p>The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. This is at most a
    three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints.
    For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that
    attendants understand its purpose.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master ensures that the meeting is positive and productive. The Scrum Master teaches all to keep it within
    the time-box. The Scrum Master participates as a peer team member in the meeting from the accountability over the
    Scrum process.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;</li>
    <li>Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,</li>
    <li>Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to improve, within the Scrum process framework, its development process
    and practices to make it more effective
    and enjoyable for the next Sprint. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to increase product
    quality by improving work processes or adapting
    the definition of "Done", if appropriate and not in conflict with product or organizational standards.</p>
<p>By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in
    the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum
    Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal
    opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.</p>
<h2><a id="artifacts" name="artifacts">Scrum Artifacts</a></h2>
<p>Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.
    Artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody
    has the same understanding of the artifact.</p>
<h3><a id="artifacts-productbacklog" name="artifacts-productbacklog">Product Backlog</a></h3>
<p>The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single
    source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product
    Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.</p>
<p>A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it lays out the initially known and best-understood
    requirements. The Product Backlog
    evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it
    constantly changes to identify what the product
    needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. If a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.</p>
<p>The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes
    to be made to the product in future
    releases. Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, estimate, and value. Product Backlog
    items often include test descriptions that
    will prove its completeness when "Done".</p>
<p>As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product Backlog becomes a larger and
    more exhaustive list. Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in
    business requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.</p>
<p>Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming
    work on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items may then be employed.</p>
<p>Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is
    an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog
    items. During Product Backlog refinement, items are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when
    refinement is done. Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team. However,
    Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.</p>
<p>Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise
    estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail. Product
    Backlog items that will occupy the Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are refined so that any one item can
    reasonably be "Done" within the Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be "Done" by the Development Team
    within one Sprint are deemed "Ready" for selection in a Sprint Planning. Product Backlog items usually acquire this
    degree of transparency through the above described refining activities.</p>
<p>The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by
    helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.</p>
<h4>Monitoring Progress Toward Goals</h4>
<p>At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner tracks this total
    work remaining at least every Sprint Review. The Product Owner compares this amount with work remaining at previous
    Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This
    information is made transparent to all stakeholders.</p>
<p>Various projective practices upon trending have been used to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or
    cumulative flows. These have proven useful.
    However, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown.
    Only what has already happened may be used for
    forward-looking decision-making.</p>
<h3><a id="artifacts-sprintbacklog" name="artifacts-sprintbacklog">Sprint Backlog</a></h3>
<p>The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the
    product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what
    functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done"
    Increment.</p>
<p>The Sprint Backlog makes visible all the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint
    Goal. To ensure continuous improvement, it includes at least
    one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective meeting.</p>
<p>The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The
    Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the
    Sprint. This emergence occurs as the Development Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed
    to achieve the Sprint Goal.</p>
<p>As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the
    estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the
    Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time
    picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the
    Development Team.</p>
<h4>Monitoring Sprint Progress</h4>
<p>At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be summed. The Development Team
    tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint
    Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the Development Team can manage its progress.</p>
<h3><a id="artifacts-increment" name="artifacts-increment">Increment</a></h3>
<p>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments
    of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint,
    the new Increment must be "Done," which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition
    of "Done". An increment is a body of inspectable, done work
    that supports empiricism at the end of the Sprint. The increment is a step toward a vision or goal. The increment
    must be in useable condition
    regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.</p>
<h2><a id="artifact-transparency" name="artifact-transparency">Artifact Transparency</a></h2>
<p>Scrum relies on transparency. Decisions to optimize value and control risk are made based on the perceived state of
    the artifacts. To the extent that transparency is complete, these decisions have a sound basis. To the extent that
    the artifacts are incompletely transparent, these decisions can be flawed, value may diminish and risk may
    increase.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master must work with the Product Owner, Development Team, and other involved parties to understand if the
    artifacts are completely transparent. There are practices for coping with incomplete transparency; the Scrum Master
    must help everyone apply the most appropriate practices in the absence of complete transparency. A Scrum Master can
    detect incomplete transparency by inspecting the artifacts, sensing patterns, listening closely to what is being
    said, and detecting differences between expected and real results.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master’s job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the transparency of the
    artifacts. This work usually involves learning, convincing, and change. Transparency doesn’t occur overnight, but is
    a path.</p>
<h3><a id="artifact-transparency-done" name="artifact-transparency-done">Definition of "Done"</a></h3>
<p>When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as "Done", everyone must understand what "Done" means.
    Although this may vary significantly per Scrum Team,
    members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency. This is
    the definition of "Done" for the Scrum Team and
    is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment.</p>
<p>The same definition guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a
    Sprint Planning. The purpose of each Sprint is to
    deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team’s current definition of
    "Done".</p>
<p>Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint. This Increment is useable, so a Product
    Owner may choose to immediately release it.
    If the definition of "Done" for an increment <em>is</em> part of the conventions, standards or guidelines of the
    development organization, all Scrum Teams must
    follow it as a minimum.</p>
<p>If "Done" for an increment is <em>not</em> a convention of the development organization, the Development Team of the
    Scrum Team must define a definition of "Done"
    appropriate for the product. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, the
    Development Teams on all the Scrum Teams must mutually
    define the definition of "Done".</p>
<p>Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work
    together.</p>
<p>As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of "Done" will expand to include more stringent criteria
    for higher quality.
    New definitions, as used, may uncover work to be done in previously "Done" increments. Any one product or system
    should have a definition of "Done" that is a standard for any work done on it.</p>
<h2><a id="endnote" name="endnote">End Note</a></h2>
<p>Scrum is free and offered in this Guide. Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and rules are immutable and although
    implementing only parts of Scrum is possible,
    the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques,
    methodologies, and practices.</p>
<h2><a id="acknowledgements" name="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h2>
<h3><a id="cknowledgements-people" name="acknowledgements-people">People</a></h3>
<p>Of the thousands of people who have contributed to Scrum, we should single out those who were instrumental at the
    start: Jeff Sutherland
    worked with Jeff McKenna and John Scumniotales, and Ken Schwaber worked with Mike Smith and Chris Martin, and all of
    them worked together. Many others contributed in the ensuing years and without their help Scrum would not be refined
    as it is today.</p>
<h3><a id="acknowledgements-history" name="acknowledgements-history">History</a></h3>
<p>Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland worked on Scrum until 1995, when they co-presented Scrum at the OOPSLA Conference in
    1995. This presentation essentially
    documented the learning that Ken and Jeff gained over the previous few years, and made public the first formal
    definition of Scrum.</p>
<p>The history of Scrum is described elsewhere. To honor the first places where it was tried and refined, we recognize
    Individual, Inc., Newspage, Fidelity Investments, and IDX (now GE Health).</p>
<p>The Scrum Guide documents Scrum as developed, evolved, and sustained for 20-plus years by Jeff Sutherland and Ken
    Schwaber. Other sources provide you with
    patterns, processes, and insights that complement the Scrum framework. These may increase productivity, value,
    creativity, and satisfaction with the results.</p>
